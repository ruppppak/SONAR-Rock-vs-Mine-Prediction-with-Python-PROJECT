## SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python 🪨⚓️
This project uses machine learning to classify sonar signals as either reflecting off rocks or mines (metal cylinders). The dataset consists of 60 features representing energy levels of sonar signals at various frequencies. It's a classic binary classification problem.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: Build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a sonar return is from a rock or a mine.
Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Sonar Dataset
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
